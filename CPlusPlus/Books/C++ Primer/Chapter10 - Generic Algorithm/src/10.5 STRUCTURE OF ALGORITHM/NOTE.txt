iterators define a common set of operations. Some operations are
provided by all iterators; other operations are supported by only specific kinds of
iterators. For example, ostream_iterators have only increment, dereference, and
assignment. Iterators on vector, strings, and deques support these operations
and the decrement, relational, and arithmetic operators

Iterators are categorized by the operations they provide and the categories form a
sort of hierarchy. With the exception of output iterators, an iterator of a higher
category provides all the operations of the iterators of a lower categories.

List the five iterator categories and the operation that each
support

(answer):
= Input iterator
  - != and == 
  - ++
  - *
  - ->

= Output iterator
  - ++
  - *
  - =

= Forward iterator
  - input and output iterator operation

= Bidirectional iterator
  - forward iterator operation
  - --

= Random-Access iterator
  - Bidirectional Iterator operation
  - +, -, +=, -=,
  - []
  - <, <=, >, >=

incrementing an input iterator may invalidate all other iterators into the stream. As
a result, there is no guarantee that we can save the state of an input iterator and
examine an element through that saved iterator

Iterators for array, deque, string, and vector are random-access iterators, as are pointers when used to
access elements of a built-in array

Most of the algorithms have one of the following four forms:
  alg(beg, end, other args)
  alg(beg, end, dest, other args)
  alg(beg, end, beg2, other args)
  alg(beg, end, beg2, end2, other args)

where alg is the name of the algorithm, and beg and end denote the input range on
which the algorithm operates
The common ones listed here—dest, beg2, and end2—are all iterators

A dest parameter is an iterator that denotes a destination in which the algorithm can
write its output. Algorithms assume that it is safe to write as many elements as
needed

Algorithms that take beg2 alone assume that the sequence beginning at
beg2 is as large as the range denoted by beg and end.

By default, algorithms that rearrange elements write the rearranged elements back
into the given input range. These algorithms provide a second version that writes to a
specified output destination.
