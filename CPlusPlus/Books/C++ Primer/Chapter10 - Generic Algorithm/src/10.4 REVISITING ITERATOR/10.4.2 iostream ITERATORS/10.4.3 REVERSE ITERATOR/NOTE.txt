A reverse iterator inverts the meaning of increment (and
decrement). Incrementing (++it) a reverse iterator moves the iterator to the previous
element; derementing (--it) moves the iterator to the next element

The containers, aside from forward_list, all have reverse iterators

What we need to do is transform rcomma back into an ordinary iterator that will go forward
through line. We can do so by calling the reverse_iteratorâ€™s base member,
which gives us its corresponding ordinary iterator
