Based only on the algorithm and argument names, describe the operation
that each of the following library algorith performs

    replace(beg, end, old_val, new_val);
    replace_if(beg, end, pred, new_val);
    replace_copy(beg, end, dest, old_val, new_val);
    replace_copy_if(beg, end, dest, pred, new_val);

(answer):

replace(beg, end, old_val, new_val);
- replace old_val with new_val from element beg to end.

replace_if(beg, end, pred, new_val);
- replace old_val that's specified by the pred with new_val from element beg to end.

replace_copy(beg, end, dest, old_val, new_val);
- the result of the replace operation is copy to dest.

replpace_copy_if(beg, end, dest, pred, new_val);
- the result of the replace_if opeartion is copy to dest.
