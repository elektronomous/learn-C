Assuming v is a vector<double>, what, if anything, is wrong 
with calling accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), 0) ?

(answer):
= The third argument is decide the result of the return value 
  from accumulate. so if it's a 0, then the result must be integer,
  long it, unsigned but when it's 0.0, then the result must be double
