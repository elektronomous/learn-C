What kinds of iterator do you think copy requires? 
What about reverse or unique?

(answer):

- copy algorithm requires only output iterator
- reverse algorithm requires clearly operation on reverse, which is Bidirectional
  iterator
- as we know that unique algorithm moves the non-unique element to the last element
  that means the unique algorithm is using random-access iterator.
