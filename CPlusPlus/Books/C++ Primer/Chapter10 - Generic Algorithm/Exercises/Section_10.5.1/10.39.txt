What kind of iterator does a list have? What about a vector?

(answer):
Try to use list when using sort algorithm, then you'll find
the compiler warns you that it was error using operator-. This means
that list doesn't provide the minus(-) operation on its iterator. Try
to use algorithm that use Bidirectional iterator, The upper category
of Bidirectional iterator

Vector is obviously is Random-access iterator.
