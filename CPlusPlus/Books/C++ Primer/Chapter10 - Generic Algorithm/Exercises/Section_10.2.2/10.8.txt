We said that algorithms do not change the size of the containers
over which they operate. Why doesn't the use of back_inserter invalidate
this claim?

(answer):
because back_inserter operation is using the push_back operation of the container.
if the container has no push_back operation (forward_list), then the container can't
be the argument of the back_inserter. you can't try it by using back_inserter on 
forward_list (10.8.cpp)
