Sales_data.hpp:
The output operators for the built-in types do little if any formatting. In particular,
they do not print newlines. Users expect class output operators to behave similarly. An
output operator that does minimal formatting lets users control the details of their output.

Input and output operators that conform to the conventions of the iostream library must be
ordinary nonmember functions These operators cannot be members of our own class. If they 
were, then the left-hand operand would have to be an object of our class type:

        Sales_data data;
        data << cout;       // if operator<< is a member of Sales_data

If you confuse, you can call the operator directly:
        
        data.operator<<(cout);

If these operators are members of any class, they would have to be members of istream or 
ostream. However, those classes are part of the standard library, and we cannot add members
to a class in the library.
