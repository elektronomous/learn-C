In § 7.5.4 (p. 294) we saw that a nonexplicit constructor that can be called with
one argument defines an implicit conversion. Such constructors convert an object
from the argument’s type to the class type. We can also define conversions from
the class type. We define a conversion from a class type by defining a conversion
operator. Converting constructors and conversion operators define class-type conversions.
Such conversions are also referred to as user-defined conversions
