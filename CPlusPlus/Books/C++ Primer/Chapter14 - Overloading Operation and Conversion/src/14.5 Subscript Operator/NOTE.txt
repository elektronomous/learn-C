Classes that represent containers from which elements can be retrieved by position
often define the subscript operator, operator[].

The subscript operator must be a member function. To be compatible with the ordinary
meaning of subscript, the subscript operator usually returns a reference to the element
that is fetched. By returning a reference, subscript can be used on either side of an
assignment. Consequently, it is also usually a good idea to define both const and
nonconst versions of this operator. When applied to a const object, subscript should
return a reference to const so that it is not possible to assign to the returned object.
