What, if anything, is wrong with the following Sales_data input operator?
What would happen if we gave this operator the data in the previous exercises?

        istream& operator>>(istream &in, Sales_data &s) {
            double price;
            in >> s.bookNo >> s.units_sold >> price;
            s.revenue = s.units_sold * price;
            return in;
        }

(answer):
= If you try to input a string into the units_sold, it's make IO failed.
  Then you get the units_sold will be an undefined value so when the result
  is assigned by this undefined value, you'll likely get the undefined result.
  You don't evaluate the IO objects here, that's wrong way to pass those code
  into the previous exercise.
