Explain how to decide whether the following should be class members:
    (a) %
    (b) %=
    (c) ++
    (d) ->
    (e) <<
    (f) &&
    (g) ==
    (h) ()

(answer):
    (a) Both operand must be a class that contain integer. We make
        it as the nonmember because we don't change the object being %.
    (b) All of the compound-assignment must be part of the member class.
    (c) Increment operator must be part of the member class since it does change
        our object state.
    (d) The access row must be part of the member class 
    (e) IO must be nonmember function because the way you implement the IO class
        type to the object being IO.
    (f) We don't change anything in the object state, but we are evaluating the
        both of object so we come up with nonmember class.
    (g) same as the (f), we're evaluating the value of the objects so we don't need
        it to be member class.
    (h) call operator must be define as member operator function.
