Both string and vector define an overloaded == operator that can
be used to compare objects of those types. Assuming svec1 and svec2
are vectors that hold strings, identify which version of == is applied
in each of the following expressions:

    (a) "cobble" == "stone"
    (b) svec1[0] == svec2[0]
    (c) svec1 == svec2
    (d) "svec1[0] == "stone"

(answer):

    (a) It's an error because const char * has no overloaded == operator
        of its own. 
    (b) Because [] operator return the element, when the == operator is
        applied to the element it's use the overloaded == operator of the
        element. which in this case is the string == overloaded operator.
    (c) It obviously use the vector == overloaded operator 
    (d) It has syntax error.
