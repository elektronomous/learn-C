In exercise 7.40 from $ 7.4.1 (p. 291) you wrote a sketch of one
of the following classes. Decide, if any, overloaded operators your
class should provide.

(answer):
= Date.hpp would provide: 
  = IO overloaded operator (<< and >>)
    - show your date
  = overloading the addition operator (+) and compound-assignment(+=):
    - you can add date by only a number of days
    - also you can add date by Date itself
  = overloading the substraction operator (-) and compound-assignment(-=):
    - you can substract by only a number of days
    - also you can substract date by Date itself
    - you can also get a range of both Date objects.
  = equality operator overloaded.
    - you evaluate both of your Date objects.
  = assignmetn operator overloaded.
    - you can assign other Date to your Date object.
