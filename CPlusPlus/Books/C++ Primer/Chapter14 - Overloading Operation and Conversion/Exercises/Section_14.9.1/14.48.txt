Determine whether the class you used in exercise 7.40 from
$ 7.5.1 (p. 291) should have a conversion to bool. If so,
explain why, and explain whether the operator should be
explicit. If not, explain why not.

(answer):
= The class that i used in that Exercises is Date class which
  represent the day, month and year. There's nothing could be
  the bool to be used as the context of this class. Because it's
  not store the state of something, it just store the numbers. If
  you read something to this object, let the IO class handle the
  failure of the input.
