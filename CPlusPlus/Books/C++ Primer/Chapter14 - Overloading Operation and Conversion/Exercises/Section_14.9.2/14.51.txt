Show the conversion sequences (if any) needed to call each version
of calc and explain why the best viable function is selected.

        void calc(int);
        void calc(LongDouble);

        double dval;
        calc(dval);     // which calc?

(answer):
= These class has two different types. The compiler will use its built-in conversion rather than
  using implicit user-defined conversion.
