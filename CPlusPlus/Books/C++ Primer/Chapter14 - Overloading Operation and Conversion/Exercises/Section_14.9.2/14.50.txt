Show the possible class-type conversion sequences for the initializations
of ex1 and ex2. Explain whether the initializations are legal or not.

        struct LongDouble {
            LongDouble(double = 0.0);
            operator double();
            operator float();
        };

        longDouble ldObj;
        int ex1 = ldObj;
        float ex2 = ldObj;

(answer):
= Since the ex1 is an int, and the LongDouble has two arithmetic-type conversion which
  return double and float value. You can convert these two types into int, in which they
  will discard their decimal point. So this is illegal since it makes the operator conversion
  ambiguous.
= Now the case of ex2 is a variable of type float. ldObj has that type operator conversion, so
  it obvious legal for the ldObj to be converted to that type.
