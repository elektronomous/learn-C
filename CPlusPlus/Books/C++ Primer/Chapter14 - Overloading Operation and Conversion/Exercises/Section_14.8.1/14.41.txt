Why do you suppose the new standard added lambdas?
Explain when you would use a lambda and when you would
write a class instead.

(answer):
= If you want the shortes code, you can go with the lambda instead
  of using function-object class. But the more you use the lambda
  the more code you would write. If the lambda seems like we will
  often use it, then I prefer to use the function-object class. If
  you use an algorithm that's only once or twice, I prefer to use
  the lambda.
