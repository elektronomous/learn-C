Given the definition of SmallInt on page 588, determine whether
the following addition expression is legal. If so, what addition
operator is used? If not, how might you change the code to make it
legal?
        SmallInt s1;
        double d = s1 + 3.14;

(answer):

        class SmallInt {
            friend SmallInt operator+(const SmallInt&, const SmallInt&);
        public:
            SmallInt(int = 0);                      // conversion from int
            operator int() const { return val; }    // conversion to int
        private:
            std::size_t val;
        };

= This is illegal since s1 could be int and 3.14 could be converted to SmallInt.
  to make it legal, you can make explicitly wrap the 3.14 as the SmallInt object or
  call the conversion operator on s1.

        double d = s1 + SmallInt(3.14);
  or
        double d = s1.operator int() + 3.14;
