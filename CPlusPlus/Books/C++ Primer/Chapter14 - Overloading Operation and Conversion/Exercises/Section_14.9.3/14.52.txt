Which operator+, if any, is selected for each of the addition
expressions? List the candidate functions, the viable functions
and the type conversions on the arguments for each viable function:

        struct LongDouble { 
            // member operator+ for illustration purposes; + is
            // usually a nonmember
            LongDouble operator+(const SmallInt&);
            LongDouble(double = 0.0);
            operator double();
            operator float();
        };
        class SmallInt {
            friend SmallInt operator+(const SmallInt&, const SmallInt&);
        public:
            SmallInt(int = 0);                      // conversion from int
            operator int() const { return val; }    // conversion to int
        private:
            std::size_t val;
        };

        LongDouble operator+(LongDouble, double);
        SmallInt si;
        LongDouble ld; 
        ld = si + ld;
        ld = ld + si;

(answer):

= There's no way to convert LongDouble to si, also the LongDouble object has two
  conversion operator that convert the object to float or double make it the ambiguous
  calls 
= the second one would be ld.operator+(const SmallInt&);
