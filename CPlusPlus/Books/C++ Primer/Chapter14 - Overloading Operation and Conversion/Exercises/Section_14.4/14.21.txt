Write the Sales_data operators so that + does the actual addition
and the += calls +. Discuss the disadvantage of this approach compared
to the way these operators were defined in $ 14.3 (p. 560) and $ 14.4
(p. 564)

(answer):

= Without further to write the Sales_data, if you add two objects then you
  expected to have some storage to store the result. Now if you add two objects
  and store the result in the first objects, you have the storage to store the
  result without expected. Those are two different operation, so when you put
  the meaning of those two in reversed, then you likely get confused eventually.
