Our StrBlobPtr class does not define the copy constructor, assignment 
operator, or a destructor. Why is that okay?

(answer):
= The member is a weak_ptr, obviously we dont control a life-time resource
  here so there's no need to create a destructor. when you create a destructor
  the copy constructor and assignment should be included too. But because we
  don't know if the object being pointed is exist, we don't need to create those
  three.
