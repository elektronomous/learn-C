1. In the binary search program on page 112, why did we write
        mid = beg + (end-beg)/2;
   instead of
        mid = (beg + end)/2;

= when you substract iterator, you get the distance. now if you divide the distance
  by 2 you get the half of the distance. then if you add to the beginning of your path
  you get the half of the distance.
  Now, if you just substract iterator you get only the half distance and if you don't know your
  beginning path(begin) you can't reach that distance.
