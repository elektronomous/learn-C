1. Given that p1 and p2 point to elements in the same array, what does the following code do?
   Are there values of p1 or p2 that make this code illegal?

        p1 += p2 - p1;

= You can derive the compound operation to ease to look what happened on it.
        p1 += p2 - p1;
        p1 = p1 + p2 - p1;
        p1 = p2;
  From this we obtain that the code is legal.
