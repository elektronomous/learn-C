1. Is the following program legal? if not, how might you fix it?
    vector<int> ivec;
    ivec[0] = 42;

= You can initializing first the vector you want to fill
  
    vector<int> ivec(10);
    ivec[0] = 42;
  
  Or you can use the push_back method after create the vector;
  
    vector<int> ivec;
    ivec.push_back(42);
  
  or you can initialize directly
    
    vector<int> ivec{42};
