1. What does the following program do?

        const char ca[] = {'h','e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};
        const char *cp = ca;

        while (*cp) {
            cout << *cp << endl;
            ++cp;
        }

= The first initialization doesn't end with null make the while loop to iterate through
  the array beyond the size of the ca.
