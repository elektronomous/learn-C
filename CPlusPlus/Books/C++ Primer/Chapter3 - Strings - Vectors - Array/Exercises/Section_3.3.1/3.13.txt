1. How many elements are there in each of the following vectors?
   What are the values of the elements?
   (a) vector<int> v1;
   = empty elements

   (b) vector<int> v2(10);
   = 10 elements, with each value initialize to 0

   (c) vector<int> v3(10, 42);
   = 10 elements, each value initialize to 42

   (d) vector<int> v4{10}
   = 1 elements initialized to 10

   (e) vector<int> v5{10, 42};
   = 2 elements, first element initialized to 10, second element initialized to 42
    
   (f) vector<string> v6{10}
   = 10 elements, each initialized with empty string

   (g) vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};
   = 10 element, each initialized with "hi"
