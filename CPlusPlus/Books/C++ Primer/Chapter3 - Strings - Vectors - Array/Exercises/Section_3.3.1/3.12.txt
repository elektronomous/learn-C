1. Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in error?
   For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those
   that are not legal explain why they are illegal.

(a) vector<vector<int>> ivec;
= Legal, we could create empty vector like this refer to the first restriction of initialization.
  int is built-in type, vector always empty-initialize the element when we supply built-in type
  with no size. Because the vector inside is initialize itself by default, we can supply it as
  another vector

(b) vector<string> svec = ivec;
= Illegal, you can copy vector but the type must match. You cannot copy int to a string vector.

(c) vector<string> svec(10, "null");
= Legal, This initialize svec with ten string, each initialize with "null"
