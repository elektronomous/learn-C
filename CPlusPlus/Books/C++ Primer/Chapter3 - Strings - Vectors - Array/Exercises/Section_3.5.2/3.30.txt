1. Identify the indexing errors in the following code:
        constexpr size_t array_size = 10;
        int ia[array_size];

        for (size_t ix = 1; ix <= array_size; ++ix)
            ia[ix] = ix;
= the ix condition should be ix < array_size, because when you define an N array
  then the subscript operator will allowed to be access from range 0 - (N-1).
