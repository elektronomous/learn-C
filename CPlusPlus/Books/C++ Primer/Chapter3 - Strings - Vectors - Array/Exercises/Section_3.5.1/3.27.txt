1. Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments and returns an int value
   which of the following definitions are illegal? explain why:
        unsigned buf_size = 1024;
        (a) int ia[buf_size];
        = Illegal, the dimension must be a constant value
        (b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14];
        = Legal, constant could be created from literal value
        (c) int ia[txt_size()];
        = Illegal, the function must be return constexpr or const int
        (d) char st[11] = "fundamental";
        = Illegal, when you initialize a literal string to an array of char you need to
          make a one space for the null('\0') character.
