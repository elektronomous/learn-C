1. List three ways to define a vector and give it ten elements, each with
   the value 42. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so and why

        typedef vector<int> vint;
=       (1) vint v(10, 42);
        (2) vint v{42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42};
        (3) vint v = vint(10, 42);

= There's only one way to define effiently is to use the first way
