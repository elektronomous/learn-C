Assignment is an example of an expresion that yields a reference type.
The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand.
That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is an int&

    int i;
    i = 10;     // return int& (reference to int) => it should be easy if it says that
                // after asssignment, the address-of the i is result of the expression

Using that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:

    int a = 3, b = 4;
    decltype(a) c = a;      // c is an int => 3
    decltype(a = b) d = a;  // d is an int& => reference to a => 3
