In the following code, determine the type of each variable and the value
each variable has when the code finishes:

    int a = 3, b = 4;
    decltype(a) c = a;      // c is an int => 3
    decltype((b)) d = a;    // d is an int& => 3
    ++c;                    // 4
    ++d;                    // 4
