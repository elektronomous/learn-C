Describe the differences in type deduction between decltype and auto.
Give an example of an expression where auto and decltype will deduce
the same type and an example where they will deduce different type.

= Example where auto and decltype deduce the same type:

    int a = 10;
    decltype(a) b = a;
    auto c = a;

    // we dont declare, this another example of deduce the same type
    decltype((a)) b = a;
    auto &c = a;

    decltype(&a) b = &a;
    auto *p = &a;

= Example where auto and decltype deduce the different type:

    int i = 10, *p = &i;

    decltype(*p) a = i;
    auto a = *p;
