Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain what's wrong
and how to correct it.
(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
= You need to define variable first then you can read value from them
    int input_value;
    std::cin >> input_value;

(b) int i = {3.14}
= list initialization will give you an error if you put initializer that likely will 
  loss when initialized.

    float i = {3.14};

(c) double salary = wage = 999.99;
= you can define one or more variable with type specifier that seperated by comma
    double salary, wage = 999.99;

(d) int i = 3.14;
= Compiler allow this but the value after the decimal point is trunctated.
  so,
        i = 3;
