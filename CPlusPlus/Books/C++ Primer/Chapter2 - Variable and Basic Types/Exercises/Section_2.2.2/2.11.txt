Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or a definitions
(a) extern int ix = 1024;
= (This is allowed if the extern is outside function body) It's definitions
(b) int iy;
= declaration and definition, we say that definition because we provide a memory here
(c) extern int iz;
= declaration, in this case we make a name(iz) known to the program, but not provide the
  memory.
