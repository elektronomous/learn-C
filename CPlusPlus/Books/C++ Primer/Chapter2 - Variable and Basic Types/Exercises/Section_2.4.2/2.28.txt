Explain the following definitions. Identify any that are illegal:
(a) int i, *const cp;
= Illegal, *const cp must be initialized since it is a const pointer.
(b) int *p1, *const p2;
= Illegal, *const p2 must be initialized since it is a const pointer.
(c) const int ic, &r = ic;
= Illegal, const int ic must be initialized because it is top-level const.
(d) const int *const p3;
= Illegal, *const p3 must be initialized because it has top-level const.
(e) const int *p;
= Legal, we could point to another const or nonconst object later.
