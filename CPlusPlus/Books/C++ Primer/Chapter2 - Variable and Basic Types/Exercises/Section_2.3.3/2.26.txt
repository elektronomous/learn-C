Which of the following are legal? For those that illegal, explain why
(a) const int buf
= Illegal, const object cannot change value after we created it so it must be initialized.
(b) const int sz
= legal
(c) int cnt = 0;
= legal
(d) ++cnt
= legal
    ++sz;
= illegal, you cant change the value of object of const type.
