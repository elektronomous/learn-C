Is the following program legal? if so, what values are printed ?
int i = 100, sum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i != 10; i++)
    sum += i;

std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;

= 100 45
  i inside the for statement has defined and its scope. so when add the sum, the i value
  found that's on the for scope, that's why c++ doesn't need to use the outer scope of i.
