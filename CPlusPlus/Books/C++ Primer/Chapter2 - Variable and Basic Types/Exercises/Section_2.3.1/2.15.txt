Which of the following definitions if any are invalid? why?
(a) int ival = 1.01;
= valid, but the number after the decimal point will be trunctated
(c) int &rval2 = ival;
= valid, since ival is an object we can refers to it
(b) int &rval1 = 1.01;
= invalid, we can't reference to a literal
(d) int &rval3;
= invalid, reference must be initialized
