1. What are the differences between int, long, long long and short?
   Between unsigned and signed type? between a float and a double?
= The differences is on the bits its hold(size). If you find the size
  int and long are same, which in this case 8 bytes the machine you use is a 64-bit. 
  If you find the them different then you use 32-bit machine.
= the differences between signed and unsigned is that when you display
  a value whether negative or positive.
= float holds for 32bit while double holds 64(bits)

2. To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate
   principal and payment? Explain why you selected each type
= the rate, principal and payment will only use double since all of the 
  number we account here is a form of decimal point. if you use integer
  then conversion will be bottleneck of the account because the program
  need some conversion integer to double method.
