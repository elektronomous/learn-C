Explain why the calls to swap inside swap(HasPtr&, HasPtr&) do not
cause recursion loop.

(answer):
= Look inside the body of swap, we say:
  - ps is a string data member 
  - i is an int data member.
  
  Now look at the statement that says: "There's no type specific version of the swap for the built-in
  type. In this case, these calls will invoke the library std::swap".
  Indeed, the i data member when get swapped, the invoke function will be std::swap. As we know when 
  using algorithm library we can sort a set of string, that's the algorithm library use the type specific
  version of swap of the string data type.
