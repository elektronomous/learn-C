Would the pointerlike version of HasPtr benefit from defining a swap
function? If so, What is the benefit ? If not, why not.

(answer):
= Both for class that act like values or pointer is benefit using this swap
  operation. When the parameter of the operator= copy initialize the argument
  the parameter will point to the argument's pointer, which when you swap the
  argument value using the left operand, the left operand will automatically
  destroyed if it reference count goes to 0.
