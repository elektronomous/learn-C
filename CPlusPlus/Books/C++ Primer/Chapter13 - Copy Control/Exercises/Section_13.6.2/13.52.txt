Explain in detail what happens in the assignments of the
HasPtr Objects on page 541. In particular, desribe step by
step what happens to values of hp, hp2 and of the rhs parameter
in the HasPtr assignment operator.

(answer):

        HasPtr hp, hp2;
        hp = hp2;
        hp = std::move(hp2);

= The first assignment makes the object of hp to called its copy-assignment
  operator which in its parameter has to copy-initialized the hp2. to copy-
  initialized, the parameter need to call its copy-constructor and then the
  body of the copy-assigment switch the hp and rhs parameter, eventually the
  rhs parameter is destroy by calling the destructor when the function is 
  finished.

= The second assignment makes the object of hp to called its copy-assignment
  operator which in its parameter has to move the hp2 to rhs because the assignment
  is to hp using std::move as an rvalue. To move hp2 to rhs, the parameter called
  its move-constructor and left the rhs to be safe-valid state. The body of the copy-
  assignment function does the same as the in the first-assignment.
