What happens when a StrBlob object is destroyed? What about StrBlobPtr?

(answer):
= when the StrBlob object is destroyed, the first object destructor member
  is called which in this case is shared_ptr. It'll free the memory allocated
  by the member data that's type is shared_ptr. The second member is a size_t,
  which destructor do nothing on built-in type.

= When the StrBlobPtr is destroyed, the weak_ptr's destructor will be called.
