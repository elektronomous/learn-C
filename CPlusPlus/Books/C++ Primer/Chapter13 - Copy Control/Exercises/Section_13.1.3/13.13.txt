A good way to understand copy-control members and constructors is to define
a simple class with these members in which each member prints its name:

    struct X {
        X() { std::cout << "X()" << std::endl; }
        X(const X&) { std::cout << "X(const X&)" << std::endl; }
    };

Add the copy-assgiment operator and destructor to X and write a program using X object
s in various ways:
    Pass them in containers; and so forth. Study the output until you are certain you
    understand when and why each copy-control member is used. As you read the output,
    remember that the compiler can omit calls to the copy constructor
