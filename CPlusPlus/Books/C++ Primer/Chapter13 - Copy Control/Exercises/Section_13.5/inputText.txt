One of the major features in the new standard is the ability to move rather than copy
an object. As we saw in ยง 13.1.1 (p. 497), copies are made in many circumstances. In
some of these circumstances, an object is immediately destroyed after it is copied. In
those cases, moving, rather than copying, the object can provide a significant
performance boost.
