Rewrite the free member to use for_each and a lambda (10.3.2, p. 288)
in place of the for loop to destroy the elements. Which implementations 
do you prefer and why?

(answer):
= If you rewind back to the 12.2.2, you safe to free the allocated object in
  reverse order. for_each in anyway is advance forward so if you use it as the
  loop for destroying the object, i would prefer the for loop.
