Why did we use postfix increment in the call to construct inside push_back?
What would happen if it use the prefix increment?

(answer):
= We use postfix so we can construct the current value before advance to next
  memory address. If it use the prefix increment then you're incrementing the
  memory address first then you construct the object.
