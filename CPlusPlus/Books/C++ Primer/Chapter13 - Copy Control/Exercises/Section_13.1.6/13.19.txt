Does your Employee class need to define its own versions of the
copy-control members? If so, why? If not, why not? Implement whatever
copy-control members you think Employee need

(answer):
= Refer to the line 23 on NOTE.txt of the 13.1.1 that's memberwise of the 
  synthesized copy constructor will copy nonstatic object to the object
  that's assigned. Also refer to the line 39 on NOTE.txt of the 13.1.2 that's
  copy assignment does the same thing as the copy constructor.
