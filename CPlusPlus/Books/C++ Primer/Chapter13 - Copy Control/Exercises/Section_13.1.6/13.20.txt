Explain what happens when we copy, assign, and destroy objects of our
TextQuery and QueryResult class from Section 12.3 (p.484).

(answer):
= If you refer back to the Exercise 12.27.cpp you get the TextQuery has members:
            
            vector<string> wordsPerLine;
            map<string, set<size_t>> wordMapLineNumber;
            size_t nWordOnFile;
            string queryStr;
  
  also QueryResult has members:

            shared_ptr<TextQuery> result;
            string status;

= Now when you copy TextQuery object, most of our type members is class members when you 
  try to copy or assign the object, it does so by using copy-control member of the class
  members. When you try to destroy the object, it does so by using the destructor of the
  class members.

= Now when you copy the QueryResult object, the shared_ptr and string copy-control member
  will do the job. when you destroy the QueryResult object, it will call the destructor
  of the class member.
