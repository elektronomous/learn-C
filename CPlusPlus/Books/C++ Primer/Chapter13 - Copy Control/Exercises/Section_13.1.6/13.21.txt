Do you think the TextQuery and QueryResult classes need to define
their own versions of the copy-control members? If so, why ? If not
, why not? Implement whichever copy-control operations do you think
theses classes require.

(answer):
= Most of our class members is a class type. so all the copy-control operations
  you'll need is provided by them. When you make your own version of copy-control
  you'll end up using the class type copy-control operations. So i think we don't
  need to define copy-control operations that these classes require.
