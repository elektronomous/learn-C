Assume numbered has a copy constructor that generates a
new serial number. Does that change the output of the calls in
the previous exercise? If so, why? What output gets generated?

(answer):

= Copy constructor means when you copy initialize the object,
  the copy constructor will be called. When you copy-initialized
  a to b, b will get new serial number, c also get the new one.
  Now when you call the f, the parameter will get copy-initialize
  (refer back to Exercise Section 13.1.3, exercise 13.13.cpp). We
  know that every time copy-initialize constructor is called, the
  object to be copied will get another serial number. That means
  in every call to f, will show different serial number but get
  the same value.
