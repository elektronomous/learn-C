What if the parameter in f were const numbered&?
Does that change the output? If so, why? What output gets
generated?

(answer):

= You'll get different output also, because when you copy-initialized
  the object b and c. that makes the b and c get another new serial number.
  when you pass them to the f with reference parameter. It doesn't change the
  serial number of the b and c and a.
