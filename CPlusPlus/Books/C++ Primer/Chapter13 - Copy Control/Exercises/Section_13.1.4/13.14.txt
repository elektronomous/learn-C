Assume that numbered is a class with a default constructor that 
generates a unique serial number for each object, which is stored in
a data member named mysn. Assuming numbered uses the synthesized copy-control
members and given the following function:

    void f (numbered s) { cout << s.mysn << endl; }

what output does the following code produce?

    numbered a, b = a, c = b;
    f(a); f(b); f(c);

(answer):

        class Numbered {
            Numbered():
                mysn(generatedValue) { }
            private:
                string mysn;
        };

    when a assign to b (b = a), the synthesized copy-control member will copy
    all of the member of a to the b. That occurs also in b assigning to c. this
    means that b and c hold the same value of the a. when you call the function
    f three times, you got the same result.
