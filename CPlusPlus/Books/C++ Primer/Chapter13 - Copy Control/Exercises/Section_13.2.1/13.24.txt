What would happen if the version of HasPtr in this section didn't
define a destructor? What if HasPtr didn't define copy constructor?

(answer):
= Clearly if you don't define for the destructor, you'll throw a resources
  that you've been allocated in this case is the string member which is make
  your program consumes a lot of resource. Imagine if your HasPtr operate on
  big scale of program.

= If you don't define the copy constructor, then you'll end up point to the same
  object. This is not good because we intended to create a class which act like
  values, not a pointer. so your object now dependent to other object. Imagine the
  object that you've used to copy-initialized another object is deleted first then
  the initialized one, your initialized object will end up to point to non-exist
  memory
