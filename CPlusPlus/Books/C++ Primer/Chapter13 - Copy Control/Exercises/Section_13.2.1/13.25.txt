Assume we want to define a version of StrBlob that acts like a value.
Also assume that we want to use a shared_ptr so that our StrBlobPtr
class can still use a weak_ptr to the vector. Your revised class will
need a copy constructor and copy-assignment operator but you will not
need a destructor. Explain what the copy constructor and copy-assignment
operators must do. Explain why the class does not need a destructor.

(answer):
= The copy-constructor will called when the StrBlob is copy-initialized.
  this copy-constructor will copy the shared_ptr, but created another new
  shared_ptr. The copy-assignment operator will do the same thing but also
  destruct the current shared_ptr first and then assign a new created shared_ptr.
  We don't need the destructor because automatically the shared_ptr have provided
  us by that.
