What happens when we copy a StrBlob? what about StrBlobPtrs?

(answer):
= Because those two class don't define the copy constructor. The class
  will synthesized the copy constructor for them. The constructor also
  implicitly could be created. The compiler can freely to copy the object
  of those two classes.

  In the case of StrBlob, when you copy its object the only member that
  will be copied is only it shared_ptr. When the shared_ptr is copied, the
  reference count of the shared_ptr will advance.

  In the case of StrBlboPtrs, when you copy its object the only member that
  will copied is the weak_ptr which could be point to object or nullptr.
