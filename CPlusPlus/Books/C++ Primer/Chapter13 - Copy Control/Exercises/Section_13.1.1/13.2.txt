Explain why the following declaration is illegal:

    Sales_data::Sales_data(Sales_data rhs);

(answer):
= Because the parameter must reference. It end up in endless loop since the
  rhs will try to copy its argument, but to copy the argument, the rhs copy
  constructor need to copy the argument of the rhs earlier and go on.
