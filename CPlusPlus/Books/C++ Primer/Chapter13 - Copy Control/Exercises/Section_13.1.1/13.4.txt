Assuming Point is a class type with a public copy constructor,
identify each use of the copy constructor in this program fragment:

    Point global;
    Point foo_bar(Point arg) {
        Point local = arg, *heap = new Point(global);
        *heap = local;
        Point pa[4] = {local, *heap};
        return *heap;
    }

(answer):
= When you call foo_bar (copy initialize)
  when the arg is assigned to local (copy initialize)
  when you return heap
  when pa[4] is initialize with two value of local and *heap
