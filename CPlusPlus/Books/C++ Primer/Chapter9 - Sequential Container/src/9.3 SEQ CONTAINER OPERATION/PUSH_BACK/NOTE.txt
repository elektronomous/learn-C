(=) When we use an object to initialize a container, or insert an object into a
    container, a copy of that objectâ€™s value is placed in the container, not the
    object itself.

(=) In the call to emplace_back, that object is created directly in space managed 
    by the container. The call to push_back creates a local temporaryobject that 
    is pushed onto the container.

(=) The arguments to an emplace function vary depending on the element type. The
    arguments must match a constructor for the element type
