= Each of the insert functions takes an iterator as its first argument.
= Because the iterator might refer to a nonexistent element off the end 
  of the container, and because it is useful to have a way to insert elements
  at the beginning of a container, element(s) are inserted before the position 
  denoted by the iterator

= Say we have empty container

= The way the insert operation works is by moving the element pointed by your iterator
  in few times depend on how many value you're going to insert. The iterator stays at
  the position where it's pointed. after that insert return that iterator.

= say now your iterator is point to element that has value 5 and you want insert
  value 7
