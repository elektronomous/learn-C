Explain how the loop from page 345 that used the return from insert to add
element to a 'list' would work if we inserted into a 'vector' instead.

    list<string> lst;
    auto iter = lst.begin();

    while (cin >> word)
        iter = lst.insert(iter, word);

(answer):

= since the list and vector use the same strategy in using push_back operation.
  The insert on the vector also return iterator to the first element inserted.
  inside while, the return iterator will be the argument of the next insert 
  operation. Remember that we're insert the value before the iterator, it similar
  like push_front
