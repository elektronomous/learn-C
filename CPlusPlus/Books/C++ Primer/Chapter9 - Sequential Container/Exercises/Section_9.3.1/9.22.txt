Assuming iv is a vector of ints, what is wrong with the following program?
How might you correct the problem(s) ?

    vector<int>::iterator iter = iv.begin(),
                          mid = iv.begin() + iv.size()/2;
    
    while (iter != mid)
        if (*iter == some_val)
            iv.insert(iter, 2 * some_val);

(answer):
= The iter must be advanced and iter must be reassigned
