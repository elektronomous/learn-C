The find operations we’ve used so far execute left to right. The library provides
analogous operations that search from right to left. The rfind member searches
for the last—that is, right-most—occurrence of the indicated substring:
string river("Mississippi");
auto first_pos = river.find("is"); // returns 1
auto last_pos = river.rfind("is"); // returns 4
find returns an index of 1, indicating the start of the first "is", while rfind
returns an index of 4, indicating the start of the last occurrence of "is".
Similarly, the find_last functions behave like the find_first functions,
except that they return the last match rather than the first:
• find_last_of searches for the last character that matches any element of
the search string.
• find_last_not_of searches for the last character that does not match any
element of the search string.
Each of these operations takes an optional second argument indicating the position
within the string to begin searching.
