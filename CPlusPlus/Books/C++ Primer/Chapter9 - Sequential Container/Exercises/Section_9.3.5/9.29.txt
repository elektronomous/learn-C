Given that vec holds 25 elements, what does vec.resize(100) do?
What if we next wrote vec.resize(10)?

(answer):
= when you resize to 100, it means that the current size is less than
  the requested element's size which make the vector to add to its element
  75 elements value-initialized. Now the current vector's size is 100, when 
  you resize to 10 elements, which is the current size is greater than the
  size requested makes the vector to shrink it to 10 elements.
