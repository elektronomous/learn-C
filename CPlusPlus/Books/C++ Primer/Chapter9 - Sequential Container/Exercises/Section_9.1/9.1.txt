Which is the most appropriate---- a vector, a deque, or a list - for the
following program tasks? Explain the rationale for your choice. If there is
no reason to prefer one or another container, explain why not.

(a) Read a fixed number of words, inserting them in the container alphabetically
    as they are entered. We'll see in the next chapter that associative containers
    are better suited to this problem.
(b) Read unknown number of words. Always insert new word at the back. Remove the value
    from the front.
(c) Read an unknown number of integers from a file. Sort the numbers and then print them 
    to standard output.

(answer):

(a) list => when you inserting alphabetically, you probably gonna compare the element of the
             middle container and inserting new value in it. 
(b) deque => since your assignment is in front and the back, the fastest container is the deque
(c) vector => You just read the number and insert it, there's no way arround to control the order.
              the sort function of the vector is fast enough too, so you don't woory to control 
              the order.
