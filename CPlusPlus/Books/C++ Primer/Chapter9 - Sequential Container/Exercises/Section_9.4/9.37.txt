Why dont list or array have capacity member?
= Array have fixed size, so we can't insert a value 
  dynamically which capacity operation won't be needed.
  list is double-linked list, its element has pointer inside 
  it which use to point to another element. To keep track its
  adjacent element, the list uses pointer of its element. Since
  it points to another element, we don't need capacity operation.
