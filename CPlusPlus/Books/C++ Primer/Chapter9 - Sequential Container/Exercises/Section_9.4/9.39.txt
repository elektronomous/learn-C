Explain what the following programming fragment does:
    vector<string> svec;
    svec.reserve(1024);
    string word;

    while (cin >> word)
        svec.push_back(word);
    svec.resize(svec.size() + svec.size()/2);

(answer):
= You're growing the vector as much as the half of 
  the size of the vector that you have been initialized.
