In the first program in this section on page 346, what would the values
of val, val2, val3 and val4 be if c.size() is 1?

    // check that there are elements before dereferencing an iterator or calling front or
    back
    if (!c.empty()) {
        // val and val2 are copies of the value of the first element in c
        auto val = *c.begin(), val2 = c.front();
        // val3 and val4 are copies of the of the last element in c
        auto last = c.end();
        auto val3 = *(--last); // can't decrement forward_list iterators
        auto val4 = c.back(); // not supported by forward_list
    }


(answer):

all val values would be:
val = 1;
val2 = 1;
val3 = 1;
val4 = 1;
