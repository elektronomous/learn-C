Assuming vi is a container of ints that includes even and odd values,
predict the behavior of the following loop. After you've analyzed this
loop, write a program to test whether your expectations were correct.

    iter = vi.begin();
    while (iter != vi.end())
        if (*iter % 2)
            iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter);
        ++iter;

(answer):
= ++iter should goes to the block of the if inside while, but 
  the if statement has no open close bracket, the ++iter is
  outside the while and if statement. this program would goes 
  loop forever.
