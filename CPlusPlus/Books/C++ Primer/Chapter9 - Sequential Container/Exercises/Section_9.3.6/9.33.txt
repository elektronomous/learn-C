In the final example in this section what would happen if
we did not assign the result of insert to begin? Write a 
program that ommits this assignment to see if your expec-
tation was correct.

    while (begin != v.end()) {
        ++begin;
        begin = v.insert(begin, 42);
        ++begin;
    }

(answer):
= If we ommits the assignment, the code would be:

    while (begin != v.end()) {
        ++begin;
        v.insert(begin, 42);
        ++begin;
    }

= Remember, the reallocated vector would make the iterator
  begin to be invalidated which is you advance iterator that
  points to no-where. My expectation would be this program 
  would crash or cause runtime-error (segmentation fault).
