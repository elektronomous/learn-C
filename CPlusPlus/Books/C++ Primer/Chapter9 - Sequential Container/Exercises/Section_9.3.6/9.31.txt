The program on page 354 to remove even-valued elements and duplicate
odd ones will not work on a list or forward_list. why? Revise the program
so that it works on these types as well. (9.31.cpp)

    vector<int> vi {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    auto iter = vi.begin();     // call begin, not cbegin because we're changing vi

    while (iter != vi.end()) {
        if (*iter % 2) {
            iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter);      // duplicate the current element
            iter += 2;                          // advance past this element and the one inserted before it
        } else
            iter = vi.erase(iter);              // remove even elements
                                                // don't advance the iterator; iter denotes the element after the one we erased
    }

(answer):
= Because list and forward list doesn't support for the iterator arithmetic,
  which you can't add the iterator after you've been inserted values.
