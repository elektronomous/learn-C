In the program on page 349 that erased a range of elements,
what happens if elem1 and elem2 are equal? What if elem2 or
both elem1 and elem2 are the off-the-end iterator?

    // delete the range of elements between two iterators
    // returns an iterator to the element just after the last removed element

    elem1 = slist.erase(elem1, elem2); // after the call elem1 == elem2

(answer):
= The way of the erase work is that the erase using loop iterator which is on
  the evaluation part, both elem isn't point on the same element. that's why when
  we passed the same value of iterator, we aren't erase anything.
