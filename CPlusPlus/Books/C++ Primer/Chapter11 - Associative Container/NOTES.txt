Associative containers support efficient lookup and retrieval by a key

map                         Associative array; holds key-value pairs
set                         Container in which key is the value is the value 
multimap                    map in which a key can appear multiple times
multiset                    set in which a key can appear multiple times 

unordered_map               map organized by hash function
unordered_set               set organized by hash function
unordered_multimap          Hashed map; keys can appear multiple times
unordered_multiset          Hashed set; keys can appear multiple times

The map and multimap types are defined in the map header; the set and multiset
types are in the set header; and the unordered containers are in the
unordered_map and unordered_set headers
