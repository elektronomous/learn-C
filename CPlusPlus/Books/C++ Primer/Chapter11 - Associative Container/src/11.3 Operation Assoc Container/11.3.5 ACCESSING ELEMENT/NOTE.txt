lower_bound and upper_bound not valid for the unordered containers.
Subscript and at operations only for map and unordered_map that are not const.

c.find(k)           Returns an iterator to the (first) element with key k, or the off-the-end
                    iterator if k is not in the container.
c.count(k)          Returns the number of elements with key k. For the containers with
                    unique keys, the result is always zero or one.
c.lower_bound(k)    Returns an iterator to the first element with key not less than k.
c.upper_bound(k)    Returns an iterator to the first element with key greater than k.
c.equal_range(k)    Returns a pair of iterators denoting the elements with key k. If k is
                    not present, both members are c.end().

When a multimap or multiset has multiple elements of a given
key, those elements will be adjacent within the container.
