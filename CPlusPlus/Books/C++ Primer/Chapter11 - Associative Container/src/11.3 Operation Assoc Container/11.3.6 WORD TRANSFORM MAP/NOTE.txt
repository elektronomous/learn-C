We’ll close this section with a program to illustrate creating, searching, and iterating across a map. We’ll write a program that, given one string, 
transforms it into another. The input to our program is two files. The first file contains rules that we will use to transform the text in the second file. 
Each rule consists of a word that might be in the input file and a phrase to use in its place. The idea is that whenever the first word appears 
in the input, we will replace it with the corresponding phrase. The second file contains the text to transform

If the contents of the word-transformation file are
    brb be right back
    k okay?
    y why
    r are
    u you
    pic picture
    thk thanks!
    l8r later
and the text we are given to transform is
    where r u
    y dont u send me a pic
    k thk l8r
then the program should generate the following output:
    where are you
    why dont you send me a picture
    okay? thanks! later
