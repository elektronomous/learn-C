we need to know about the library type named pair, which is defined in the utility header
We must supply two type names when we create a pair. 

    pair<string, string> anon;          // holds two string
    pair<string, size_t> word_count;    // holds a string and a size_t
    pair<string, vector<int>> line;     // holds a string and a vector<int>

The default pair constructor value initializes (ยง 3.3.1, p. 98) the data members.
Thus, anon is a pair of two empty strings, and line holds an empty string
and an empty vector. The size_t value in word_count gets the value 0, and
the string member is initialized to the empty string. To initialize the pair:

    pair<string, string> authors {"Joyce", "James"};

Unlike other library types, the data members of pair are public (ยง 7.2, p. 268).
These members are named first and second, respectively. We access these
members using the normal member access notation (ยง 1.5.2, p. 23)

    // print the results
    cout << w.first << " occurs " << w.second
    << ((w.second > 1) ? " times" : " time") << endl;

Here, w is a reference to an element in a map
