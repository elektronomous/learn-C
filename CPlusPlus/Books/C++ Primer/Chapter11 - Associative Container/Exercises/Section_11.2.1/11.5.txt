Explain the difference between a map and a set. When might you 
use on or the other?

(answer):

- A map has a value and a set don't. We get the value based on something,
  that's a map do its job, while set just get the key combine as the value.
  You use the map when you need store something as the value you'll retrieve
  by the key and you use the set when you just need that key.
