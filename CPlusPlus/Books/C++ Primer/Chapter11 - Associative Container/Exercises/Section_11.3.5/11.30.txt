Explain the meaning of the operand pos.first->second used in
the output expression of the final program in this section.

(answer):

we know that the program returns something like this:

    pair<multimap<string, string>::iterator, multimap<string, string>::iterator> pos;

now if you access the value like this:

    pos.first           => you get iterator to the first key element.
    pos.first->second   => access the value of the iterator returned by pos.first
