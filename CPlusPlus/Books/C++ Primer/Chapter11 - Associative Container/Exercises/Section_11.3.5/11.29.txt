What do upper_bound, lower_bound, and equal_range return
when you pass them a key that's not in the container?

(answer):
= all of them will return iterator which point to the element
  that can be insert the key without disrupting the order of the element.
  If the key larger than any other key in the container, all of them will
  return off-the-end iterator.
