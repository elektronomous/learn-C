Our program does no checking on the validity of either input file.
In particular, it assumes that the rules in the transformation files
are all sensible. What would happen if a line in that file has key, 
one space and then the end of the line?
Predict the behavior and check it against your version of the program.

(answer):

the value will contain string::npos.
