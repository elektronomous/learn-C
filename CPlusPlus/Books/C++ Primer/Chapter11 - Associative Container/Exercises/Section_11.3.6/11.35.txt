In BuildMap, what effect, if any, would there be from rewriting
    
    trans_map[key] = value.substr(1);
    as
    trans_map.insert({key, value.substr(1)})

(answer):
= The effect is that we can't update the value. When insert do their job 
  on the same key, it doesn't modify that key. But using subscript operator
  on the same key will update the value of the key.
