Give an eaxmple of when each of list, vector, deque,
map and set might be most useful

(answer):
- list      -> Most useful when you have a list of a name
- vector    -> Most useful when you have a something that has to be search randomly
- deque     -> Most useful when you have a queue control over process execution of a program
- map       -> Most useful when you create a dictionary or create a list of meaning word
- set       -> Most useful when you want find something fast in a list
