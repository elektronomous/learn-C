Here, we use decltype to specify the type of our operation, remembering that
when we use decltype to form a function pointer, we must add a * to indicate
that we’re using a pointer to the given function type (§ 6.7, p. 250). We initialize bookstore from compareIsbn, which means that when we add elements
to bookstore, those elements will be ordered by calling compareIsbn. That is,
the elements in bookstore will be ordered by their ISBN members. We can write
compareIsbn instead of &compareIsbn as the constructor argument because
when we use the name of a function, it is automatically converted into a pointer if
needed (§ 6.7, p. 248). We could have written &compareIsbn with the same effect.
