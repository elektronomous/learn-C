Assuming word_count is a map from string to size_t and word is
a string, explain the following loop:

    while (cin >> word) {
        ++word_count.insert({word, 0}).first->second;
    }

(answer):

= On each iteration, the story goes to:
    
    word_count.insert({word, 0})        => insert the word to the key, 0 to the value of the map
    .first                              => access the key of the pair return by the insert
    ->second                            => access the value of the key of the pair
    ++                                  => then increment the value.
