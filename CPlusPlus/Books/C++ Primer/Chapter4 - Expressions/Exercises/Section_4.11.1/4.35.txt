Given the following definitions:

    char cval;      int ival;       unsigned int ui;
    float fval;     double dval;

identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:

(a) cval = 'a' + 3;
    = in the first place 'a' will be converted to int
    = the result of the addition would be converted 
    = to character value

(b) fval = ui - ival * 1.0;
    = refer to the association, the operation works would be

        fval = ui - (ival * 1.0);
    
    = first int would be converted to double
    = because there ui and double have different signedess
    = the operation would machine dependent.
    = if the ui has more bits than the double converted to ui
    = if the double do, then ui converted to double

(c) dval = ui * fval;
    = int would be converted to float
    = the result would be float 
    = the assignment make the float converted again
    = to the double's type value

(d) cval = ival + fval + dval;
    = we have 3 operation which is has the same 
    = precedence, so we're looking at the association
    = we begin from left
    = int would converted to float
    = the result would be float
    = float result would be converted to double
    = the double's result finally converted to 
    = char's type
