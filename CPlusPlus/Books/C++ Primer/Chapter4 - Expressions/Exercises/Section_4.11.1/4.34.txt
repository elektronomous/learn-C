Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions
take place in the following expressions:

(a) if (fval)
    = float value converted to bool value.
    = if float value is nonzero, the bool always true
    = otherwise it's false.

(b) dval = fval + ival;
    = first ival promoted to float's type
    = then the result of the addition which is float
    = promoted to double's type

(c) dval + ival * cval;
    = the operations would be like
        dval + (ival * cval)
    
    = now we clear how the conversion works
    = first char would be promoted to int
    = after the result of the multiplication which is an int
    = promoted again to double
