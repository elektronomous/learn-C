Explain the following loop.

        constexpr int size = 5;
        int ia[size] {1,2,3,4,5};

        for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0; ix != size && ptr != ia+size; ++ix, ++*ptr) {

        }

= You can get the conclusions of the works of the for-loop by looking
  at its second statement:
  this loop makes sure that it wouldn't access outside of the bound of the array
