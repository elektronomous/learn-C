Explain the behavior of the condition in the following if:

        const char *cp = "Hello World";
        if (cp && *cp)

= cp will be always true if it's not contain / point to zero value  (in this case null)
= *cp will be always true if it's not contain empty string
= Both operand will be evaluated
