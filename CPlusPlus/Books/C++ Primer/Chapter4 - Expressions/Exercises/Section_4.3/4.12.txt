Assuming i, j, and k are all ints, explain what i != j < k means

= because the precedence of the < (less than) operator is higher
  than the != (inequality) operator, then the evaluation will be
  
        i != (j < k)

  which says, if j less than k and the result of both operation will
  compare using inequality operator(!=) with i.
