Predict the output of the following code and explain your
reasoning. Now run the program. Is the output what you expected?
If not, figure out why.

        if x[10];       int *p = x;
        
        cout << sizeof (x)/sizeof (*x) << endl;
        cout << sizeof (p)/sizeof (*p) << endl;

= When you access the uninitialized element of an array you get 
  undefined value which is result the runtime error. for the purpose
  of the lesson, the undefined value could be random value it could be
  0, 1, -32452345, and so on. Unfortunately the program should be crash
  if you divided a value by the value 0 that you access on an array that has
  undefined value.
