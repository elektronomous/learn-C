What are the values of i and d after each assignment?
        int i;      double d;
        d = i = 3.5;        i = d = 3.5;

(1) = d will be converted to 3 because the first assignment has type int
      which convert the literal 3.5 to 3
    = i still get 3 because the literal value 3.5 will get converted.
