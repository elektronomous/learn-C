What would happen if the while loop on page 148 that prints the elements
from a vector used the prefix increment operator?

    std::vector<int>::iterator pbeg = v.begin();

    while (pbeg != v.end() && *beg >= 0)
        cout << *pbeg++ << endl;

= It will miss the first pbeg, and when the last pbeg are about to cout to the screen
  the pbeg are incremented, and pbeg are point to object that doesn't exist
  which cout will displays undefined value.
