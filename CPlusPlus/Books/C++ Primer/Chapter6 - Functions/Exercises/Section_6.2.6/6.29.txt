When you use an initializer_list in a range for would you
ever use a reference as the loop control variable? If so,
why? if not, why not?

(answer):

= We can't control loop over range-for since you just iterate
  through the element. You control the loop by using for-loop
  which in each iterate it's checks its condition before execute
  the statement body of for-loop.
