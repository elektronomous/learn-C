Given the declarations for f from page 242, list the viable
functions, if any for each of the following calls. Indicate which
function is the best match, or if the call is illegal whether there
is no match or why the call is amibigous.

    void f();
    void f(int);
    void f(int, int);
    void f(double, double = 3.14);

(a) f(2.56, 42)     => It's matching two calls, it's ambigous
(b) f(42)           => It's matching the second candidate, it's legal.
(c) f(42, 0)        => It's best matching the third candidate, it's legal.
(d) f(2.56, 3.14)   => It's best matching the fourth candidate, it's legal.
