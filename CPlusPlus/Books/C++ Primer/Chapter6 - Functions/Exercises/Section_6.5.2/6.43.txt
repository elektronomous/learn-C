Which one of the following declarations and definitions would put
in a header? In a source file? Explain why.

(a) inline bool eq(const BigInt&, const BigInt&) {...}
(b) void putValues(int *arr, int size);

(answer):

(a) = inline and constexpr declaration and definitions should be in the header files
(b) = the declaration of other than inline and constexpr function would go to the 
      header files
