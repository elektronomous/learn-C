Explain the differences between a parameter, a local variable,
and a local static variable. given an example of a function in
each might be usefull

(answer): 
(1) a parameter is a path to control the function
(2) a local variable is a variable define inside a function body
  which hide its name from outside scope and its lifetime is limit to
  only executing their function.
(3) a local static variable is a local variable which is persist their value
  accross calls.

(1)
    int getOneOrZero(int val) {
        if (val)
            return 1;
        
        return 0;
    }

(2) go to the src folder, the factorial function is the one which make
    local variable usefull

(3) debugging program, how many times a function called. go to the
    HowManyCall.cpp on src folder
