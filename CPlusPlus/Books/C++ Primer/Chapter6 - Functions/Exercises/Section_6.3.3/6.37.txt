Write three additional declarations for the function in
the previous exercise. One should use a type alias, one 
should use a trailing return, and the third should use 
decltype. Which form do you prefer and why ?

(answer):

= using type alias (typedef):

    typedef string arrStr[10];      // array of ten strings
    arrStr *function(void);         // return an array of ten strings

= using trailing return

    auto function -> string (*)[10];

= using decltype

    string arrStr[] = {"hello", "world"}

    // return pointer to an array of 2 strings
    decltype(arrStr) *function(void);

= I would go for the trailing return type is the easiest since you can 
  see the return type
