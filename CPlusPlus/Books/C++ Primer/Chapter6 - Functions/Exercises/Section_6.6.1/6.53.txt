Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of
the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.

(a)
    int calc(int &, int &);
    int calc(const int &, const int &);

    = The second declarations has refer to the low-level const int,
      so it's legal to declare it.

(b) 
    int calc(char *, char *);
    int calc(const char *, const char *);

    = The second declarations has point to const int, so it's legal
      to declare it.

(c)
    int calc(char *, char*);
    int calc(char *const, char *const);

    = The parameter ignored the top-level, so this redeclare the first
      declaration and it's illegal.
