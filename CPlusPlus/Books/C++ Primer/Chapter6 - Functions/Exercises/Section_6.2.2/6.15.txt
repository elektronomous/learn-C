Explain the rationale for the type of each of find_char's
parameters in particular, why is 's' a reference to const
but 'occurs' is a plain reference? Why are these parameters
references, but the char parameter is not? What would happen
if we made s a plain reference? What if we made occurs a reference
to const?


(answer):

= Why is 's' a reference to const but 'occurs is a plain reference?
  = We're going to search through may be a string with larger text,
    and we don't want to modify the s in purpose because we're using
    to look for a character.
  = We use occurs to count how many characters, so you don't use reference
    to const because we can't modify it later.

= Why are these parameters references, but the char parameter is not?
  = Since it just only one character and it's small we're okay to copy
    the value to the parameter. We can also create the parameter to reference
    to const only for this parameter if we'd like.

= What would happen if we made 's' a plain reference?
  = It would be inneficient since we would maybe encounter a gigabyte txt file
    just look for a character and how many time it occurs.

= What if we made occurs a reference to const?
  = You don't get the result of how many times the character you're looking for 
    is occur.
