Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of
assert:

    string s;
    while (cin >> s && s != shought) { }    // empty body
    assert(cin);


(answer):

= The loop checks whether the sought is found, if found then checks
  the object cin using assert. If the cin failed for example it's not 
  good idea to using the assert to validate the failed, it's just use 
  for testing your code whether it's result in failed or success. Then you
  use try and catch for production code.
