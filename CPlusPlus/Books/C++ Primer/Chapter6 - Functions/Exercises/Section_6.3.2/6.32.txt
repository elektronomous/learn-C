Indicate whether the following function is legal. If so,
explain what it does; if not, correct any errors and then 
explain it.

    int &get(int *arry, int index) {
        return arry[index];
    }

    int main(void) {
        int ia[10];
        for (int i = 0; i != 10; i++)
            get(ia, i) = i;
    }

(answer):

= Since you cannot copy an array, you bound the array argument in the parameter.
  The function get is legal and you get the return value in a reference to array 
  that you passed. This function work by pass an array and the index you want to
  get on the array
