What would happen if the stopping condition in factorial were

    if (val != 0)

(answer):

= Say that you're decrementing your factorial which is result maybe could
  cross the zero value, it's a minus value. the condition will be always true 
  since val isn't a zero, it would be cause recursion-loop.
