Which, if either, of the following declarations are errors? Why?

(a) int ff(int a, int b = 0, int c = 0);
(b) char *init(int ht = 24, int wd, char bckgrnd);

(answer):

(a) It's legal definitions, since the two right-most of the parameter are
    default arguments.
(b) It's an error, because after you declare the default arguments on one
    parameter, the subsequent parameter must also be initialized with default
    argument.
