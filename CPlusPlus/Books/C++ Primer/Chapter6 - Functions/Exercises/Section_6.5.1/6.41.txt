Which if any, of the following calls are illegal? Why? Which,
if any, are legal but unlikely to match the programmer's intent?
Why?

    char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' ');

(a) init();
(b) init(24,10);
(c) init(14, '*');

(answer):

(a) It's an error, you must supply the first parameter with an argument.
(b) The call will result in ht initialized with 24, and wd with 10 which is legal

        init(24,10) => init(int ht = 24, int wd = 10, char bckgrnd = ' ');

(c) The call will result in ht initialized with 14, and the wd is '*' which is legal

        init(14, '*') => init(int ht = 14, int wd = '*' /* converted to int */, char bckgrnd = ' ');
