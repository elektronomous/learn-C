What whould happen if we gave Screen a size member
defined as follows? Fix any problems you identify.

    pos Screen::size(void) const {
        return height * width;
    }

(answer):

= pos is seen before we're in the scope of Screen

    Screen::pos Screen::size(void) const {
        return height * width;
    }
