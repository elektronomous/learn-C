Which, if any, of the following statements in are untrue?
Why?

(answer):
(a) A class must provide at least one constructor
(b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.
(c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should
    not provide a default constructor
(d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler generates
    one that initializes each data member to the default value of its associated
    type.

(answer):
(a) = False. If the one constructor is default constructor, that would be fine. If any
      other constructor you need to define other default constructor.

(b) = False. It contains zero or more parameter list.
(c) = False. It should provide the default constructor because compiler could decide 
      what value it's contains.

(d) = True. It's called synthesized default constructor.
