Would it be legal for both constructor that takes a string
and the one that takes an istream& to have default arguments?
If not, why not?

(answer):
= Both of them are legal but since we need the book number (ISBN), 
  when we create object we must supply the book number with a value
  not empty value. In this case the default string argument won't 
  help. But the default istream& will help because it force user to
  enter the book number.
