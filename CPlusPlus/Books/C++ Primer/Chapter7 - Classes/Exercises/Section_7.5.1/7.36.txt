The following initializer is in error. Identify and fix the problem

    struct X {
        X(int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) { }
        int rem, base;
    };

(answer):

= The order of initialization is begin from rem, then base.
  When you compute uninitialized variable the result will be
  uninitialized value.

    struct X {
        X(int i, int j):  base(i), rem(i % j) { }
        int rem, base;
    };
