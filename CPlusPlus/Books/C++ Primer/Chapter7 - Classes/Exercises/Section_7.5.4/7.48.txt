Assuming the Sales_data constructors are not explicit,
What operations happen during the following definitions:

    string null_isbn("9-999-99999-9");
    Sales_data item1(null_isbn);
    Sales_data item2("9-999-99999-9");

What happens if the Sales_data constructors are explicit?

(answer):

= Whether the Sales_data is explicit or not, this will happen:
= The second statment will call the constructor that takes string as its 
  parameter and construct the object.
= The third statement will do the same as the second statement.
