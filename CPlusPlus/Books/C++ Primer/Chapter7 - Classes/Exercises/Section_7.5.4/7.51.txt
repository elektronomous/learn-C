Why do you think vector defines its single-argument
constructor as explicit, but string does not?

(answer):
= Say that when the vector single-argument constructor is explicit
  and then you copy initiazalation (assign with =) with integer value 
  or double value. It such an awkward assignment.

= because string type only accept one type of value that is enclosed with 
  double-quotes. and the type represents the unit of sequence of character.
