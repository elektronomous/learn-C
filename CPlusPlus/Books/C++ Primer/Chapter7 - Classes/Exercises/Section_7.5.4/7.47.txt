Explain whether the Sales_data constructor that takes a string 
should be explicit. What are the benefits of making the constructor
explicit? What are the drawbacks?

(answer):

= It should be explicit because user could be assign any other string intended
  that the other member(price, units_sold, revenue) will be keep in its value.
  But the result is that, when you assign only string you'll get an empty member
  except for the bookNo.
= One of the benefit is the user forced to fill all member of the object.
= the drawback could be for example you wanna create a temporary object with only 
  ISBN. you must doing conversion explicitly, making the code longer especially
  the all of member of the temporary object filled.
