Determine whether any of your Person class constructors
should be explicit?

(answer):
= Look at the Person.hpp
= Because the members are strings, we make the one of the constructor
  to be explicit. User could misuse the Person class. The Person only
  accept name as the constructor not any other string value that's not
  a name, such address or gender etc.
