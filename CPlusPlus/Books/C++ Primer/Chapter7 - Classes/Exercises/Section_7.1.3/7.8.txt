why does read define its Sales_data parameter as plain reference
and print define its parameter as a reference to const?

(answer):
= because the read parameter will be modified, we're going to input 
  a value to the object, so we're modifying it.

= because the print parameter only read the value from the object, instead
  of modifying it.
