Using our first version of Sales_data from 2.6.1 (p.27),
explain the following initialization. Identify and fix any problems

    struct Sales_data {
            std::string bookNo;             // include the string header in main program, not here
            unsigned units_sold = 0;
            double revenue = 0.0;
    };

    Sales_data item = {"978-0590353403", 25, 15.99};

(answer):

= The order of the initialization is the order of the member declaration inside 
  the Sales_data. The first member declaration is bookNo, and then units_sold and
  finally the revenue. So the order will goes:

  (1) bookNo = "978-0590353403"
  (2) units_sold = 25
  (3) revenue = 15.99
