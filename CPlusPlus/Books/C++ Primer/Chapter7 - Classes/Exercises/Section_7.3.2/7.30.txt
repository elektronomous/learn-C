It's legal but redundant to refer to members through the this pointer.
Discuss the the pros and cons of explicitly using the this pointer to
access members.

(answer):
= When defining a member function outside the class, you're using the scope
  operator(::) to indicate that the function is own by a class. from this we
  can refer to the data members without this keyword. But think when the local
  data of the member function is involves in. We can't seperate which is data 
  member of the class or the local data function. Then we need this keyword to
  help us to clear our insight.
