Which, if any, of the following static data member declarations
and definitions are errors? Explain why.

    class Example {
        public:
            static double rate = 6.5;           // error #1
            static const int vecSize = 20;
            static vector<double> vec(vecSize); // error #2
    };

    #include "Example.h"

    double Example::rate;
    vector<double> Example::vec;

(answer):
= Look at the 7.58.cpp
= On the error #1, we can only provide in-class initializer for static members
  that have const type or constexpr.
= On the error #2 the parantheses is a part of the initialization of a static member,
  and because vector isn't const or constexpr it needs to define and initialized 
  outside the class scope.
