What is a static class member? What are the advantages of static members?
How do they differ from ordinary members?

(answer):
= A static class member is a member which isn't related to object generated
  by the constructor
= Since it's related to the class, we can access the same value accross objects.
= Ordinary member has independent value, which seperated on each object. The static
  class members are not, they have the same value accross objects. You can access
  static class member via object or usign the class name and the scope operator. You 
  access ordinary data member through an object, you can't access them via class.
