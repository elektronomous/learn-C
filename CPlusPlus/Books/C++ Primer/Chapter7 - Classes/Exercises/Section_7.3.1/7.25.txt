Can Screen rely on the default versions of copy and assignment?
If so, why? If not, why not?

(answer):
= As the book says, if your class manage a memory resource manually
  then default version of copy and assignment won't work. But if your
  class has a type that handle the management like string and vector
  it's not necessary to manage that memory since the type will manage
  for us. The Screen itself use the string as its data member so we say 
  that default version of copy and assignment will work for us.
