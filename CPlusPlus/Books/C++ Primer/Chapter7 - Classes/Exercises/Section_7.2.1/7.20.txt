What are friends useful? Discuss the pros and cons of using friends.

(answer):
= It's useful because it could add/substitute the major function of your 
  object. If you feel the overloaded operator is difficult for you
  than use this friend function. It makes clear when using named function
  than overload operator sometimes. Say that your Person class, we know 
  that a person object has unique behaviour. Now you want to change the address
  of the person that's unlikely to be part of the implementations, right?
  you add the friends function that makes the address of the person is change.

= The cons of using this friends is that it could mistakenly modified the 
  state of the object since it's not part of the implementations of the object.
