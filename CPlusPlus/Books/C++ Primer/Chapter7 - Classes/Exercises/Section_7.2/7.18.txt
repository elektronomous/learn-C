What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?

(answer):
= encapsulation is a way that you hide the implementation of
  how the object works. This implementation is a combined of data
  and the method (function) that you use to modify that data so
  the behaviour of the object itself is represented by how that
  implementation works.
= It's useful because it simplify the works when use the object
  of some type.
