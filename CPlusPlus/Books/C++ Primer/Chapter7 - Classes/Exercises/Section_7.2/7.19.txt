Indicate which members of your Person class you would declare as public
and which you would declare as private. Explain your choice.

(answer):

= Surely the public member is the constructor and the interface (method) for 
  the Person class. The private for the data member. You dont want public know your
  name and address right? It's your identity so our program don't want you to 
  spread your identity by choosing the data member to be private. Everybody has right
  for asking your name and address and it would be our interface. Whether your want 
  to answer or not, that's up to you.
