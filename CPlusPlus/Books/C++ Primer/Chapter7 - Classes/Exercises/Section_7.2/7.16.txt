What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an
access specifier may appear inside a class definition? What
kinds of members should be defined after a public specifier?
What kinds should be private?

Note:
    constraint = batasan
(answer):

= There's no such constraint on where and how often an access
  specifier may appear inside a class. you can put it anywhere
  in the class.
= Generally, the members that would be appear after public specifier
  is the interface(member function, constructor) of the object.
= For the private specifier, it would be data members and member function
  that is only related for the class itself.
