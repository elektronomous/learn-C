The following expression fails to compile due to operator precedence.
Using table 4.12(166), explain why it fails. How ould you fix it ?

    string s = "word";
    string p1 = s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s";

= It decide wether the s is a "word" or "words"

    string p1 = s + ( (s[s.size() - 1] == 's') ? "" : "s");
