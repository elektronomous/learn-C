Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass and
fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right associative.
Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator were left associative.

= We create the mini-example so we can short our time
= say that grade is 80 and the conditional operator's describe as the following:

        string resultGrade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass" :
                             (grade > 70) ? "pass"      : "fail";

= Now what happens when the conditional operator is left-associative ?
= The grade will be evaluate from left-to-right

    ( (grade > 90) "high pass" : (grade > 70)) ? "pass" : "fail";

= (assume the first condition is true) the second condition result will be depend on 
  the result of the first condition which is not we intended. To make clean, we use 
  the same code using the if-statement:

    if (grade > 90)
        resultGrade = "high pass";
    else
        temp = "pass";
    

    if (temp)
        resultGrade = "pass";
    else
        resultGrade = "fail";
