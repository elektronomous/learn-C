In our grading example in this section, what would happen if we 
used unsigned int as the type for quiz1 ?

= in my computer, unsigned int is 32-bit but the book says that it's 
  guaranted to be 16-bit so we're solving this exercise according to
  book's statement.

  since the bitwise AND, OR and XOR operator dont promoted the
  left operand the number of bits the left operand has will be 
  evaluated by the first 16-bit of the right-operand (if the operand
  has more than 16-bit value)

  so it always results in zero value, because we dont have a 27-bit
  in unsigned int
