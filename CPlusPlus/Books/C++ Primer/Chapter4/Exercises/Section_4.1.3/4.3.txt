Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined
to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents
a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the 
use of language by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off?
Why or why not ? 

= It's acceptable since some operands are function, which is need some optimization.
  If this function is huge, then the function need to be optimize to make it faster
  when evaluating in using operator.
