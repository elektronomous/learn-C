Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the programmer
expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.
(a) if (p = getPtr() != 0)
    = if ((p = getPtr()) != 0)

(b) if (i = 1024)
    = This maybe a missleading from the author of code, so the better 
        if (i == 1024)
