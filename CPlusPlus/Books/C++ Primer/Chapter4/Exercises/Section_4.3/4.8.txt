Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical AND, logical OR
and equality operators

= LOGICAL AND
  = left operands are evaluated first, and if only left operands
    are true then evaluate the right operands.
= LOGICAL OR
  = left operands are evaluated first, and if only left operands are
    false then evaluate the right operands.
= EQUALITY
  = if both operands are same, then the conditions are true otherwise
    false.
