= if you ask why the conditional operator (?:) should right associative ?

  = say that you have nested condition like this:
    
            int z = a == b ? 1 : 
                    0 ? false  : true;
  
  = If the conditional operator has left associative, then the result of second 
    condition is depend on the first condition instead of the second condition itself.

            int z = ( (a == b) ? 1 : 0) ? false : true;

  = so it first evaluate the first condition

            a == b ?  1 : 0;

  = then the result of this condition will be the condition of the second condition
    which is not what we intended.

= It can be depicted using the if-statement:

    if (a == b)
        temp = 1;
    else
        temp = 0;
    

    if (temp)
        false;
    else
        true

= What we intended is:

    
    if (a == b)
        temp = 1;
    else {
        temp = 0;
        if (temp)
            false;
        else
            true;
    }
