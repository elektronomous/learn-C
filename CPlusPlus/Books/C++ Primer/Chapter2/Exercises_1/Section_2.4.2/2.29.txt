Using the variables in the previous Exercise, which of the following assignment
are legal? Explain why:
(a) i = ic;
= Legal, since assignment only copy the object not modify it.
(b) p1 = p3;
= Illegal, when copying an object the low-level const are never ignored.
(c) p1 = &ic;
= Illegal, p1 is a pointer to in not pointer to const int.
(d) p3 = &ic;
= Legal, p3 is const pointer to pointer to int. the matter is the low-levl const where the pointer
  points to.
(e) p2 = p1;
= Legal, there's now low-levl const are involved here.
(f) ic = *p3;
= Legal, both has low-level but this assignment only copy the object value.
