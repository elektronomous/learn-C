Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine whether the
following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or low-level
const applies in each case:
(a) r1 = v2;
= Both const low-level or top-level aren't involved here
(b) p1 = p2;
= p2 has low-level const, it's an error to assign pointer to int with pointer to const int
(c) p1 = p3;
= p3 has low-level const, it's an error to assign pointer to int with pointer to const int.
(d) p2 = p3;
= both of them has low-level const, so p2 can point to address that p3 pointed.
