Is the following code legal or not? If not, how might you make
it legal?

int null = 0, *p = null;
= we dont create a declarator as the one of the keywords that the language provided.
  so we replace null name by zero. when you initialize the pointer, you need the address-of
  the object you want to point, not the object itself. so we make it legal be like:

int zero = 0, *p = &zero;
