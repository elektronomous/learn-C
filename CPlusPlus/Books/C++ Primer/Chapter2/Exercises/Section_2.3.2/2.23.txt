Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a valid object?
if so, how ? if not, why not?

= You can use pointer as condition, using if statement this will give you a result
  whether the pointer is valid or not. Pointer that's initialized an object (only 
  declare, not defined) will result in false, this will give you a sign that the pointer
  you try to access is uninitialized(invalid if you try to access it).
