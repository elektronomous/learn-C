Determine the types and values of each of the following variables
(a) int* ip, i, &r = i;
= *ip is uninitialized pointer that point to int object.
  i is an uninitialized int.
  &r is the reference to an int object.

(b) int i, *p = 0;
= i is an uninitialized int.
  *p is a pointer that defined to null.

(c) int* ip, ip2;
= *ip is uninitialized pointer that point to int object.
   ip2 is uninitialized int.
