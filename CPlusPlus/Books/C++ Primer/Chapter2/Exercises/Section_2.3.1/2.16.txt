Which if any of the following assignments are invalid ? if they are
valid, explain what they do.

int i = 0, &r1 = i;
double d = 0, &r2 = d;

(a) r2 = 3.14159;
= valid, the object on which r2 refers change its value to 3.14159
(b) r2 = r1
= invalid, reference must match its type and the object type it references.
(c) i = r2
= valid, i will assign to r2 but the number after the decimal point will be trunctated
(d) r1 = d;
= valid, since the object it refers is an int and this is an assign to a double.
