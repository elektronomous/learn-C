We did not make the constructor that takes an initializer_list explicit.
Discuss the pros and const of this design choice.

(answer)
= say that you have 2 StrBlob object, which the one you have you want its back() compare
  with the second one's back(). The second one is created temporarily:
    
    StrBlob yourStrBlob({"a","an","the"});
    
    if (yourStrBlob.back() == StrBlob({"a","an","the"}).back())
        cout << "The back of each StrBlob are the same" << endl;
    else
        cout << "They're diffrent" << endl;

= When the temporarily object is created, the reference count is 1. After the if
  statement the temporarily object is out of range, decrement its reference count
  and destroyed the object.
