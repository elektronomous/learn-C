What would happen if we called the process as follows?

    process(shared_ptr<int>(p.get()));

(answer):
= Because this is the temporary object, after this call the p will 
  point to object that no longer exist or p is dangling pointer. the
  temporary shared_ptr will destroy its memory after the called.
