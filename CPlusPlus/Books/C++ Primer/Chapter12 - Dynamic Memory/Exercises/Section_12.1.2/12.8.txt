Explain what if anything is wrong with the following function.

    bool b() {
        int *p = new int;
        // ...
        return p;
    }

(answer):
afterh *p is initialized with dynamic memory, it should be freed and the pointer
have to initialize with nullptr after that. But the program dont do so, so this program
leak some memory resource.
