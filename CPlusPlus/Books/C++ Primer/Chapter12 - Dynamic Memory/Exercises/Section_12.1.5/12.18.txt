Why doesn't shared_ptr have a release member?

(answer):
remember that destructor of the shared_ptr will delete the address
we've allocated. Now if you release the address of the shared_ptr, what
the destructor will left is an address that point to nothing which is a 
dangling pointer and it's gonna delete that address. It's gonna crash the program.
Also if you release the memory to another shared_ptr that point to another address,
how the other shared_ptr will delete the address it currently pointed.
