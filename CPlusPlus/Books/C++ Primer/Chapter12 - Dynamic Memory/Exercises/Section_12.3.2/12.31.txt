What difference(s) would it make if we used a vector instead of a set
to hold the line numbers? Which approach is better? and why?

(answer):
set has unique value on each of its element. so when you insert something
that's currently exist. it does nothing. 
when you use vector, you can insert same value as you've inserted it previously
make it the element not unique and everytime you inserting a value the vector grows. 
it's not efficient because it take much larger storage then the set.
