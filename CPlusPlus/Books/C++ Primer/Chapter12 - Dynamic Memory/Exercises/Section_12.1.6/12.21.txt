We could have written StrBlobPtr's deref member as follows:

    std::string& deref() const {
        return (*check(curr, "dereference past the end"))[curr];
    }

which version do you think is better and why?

(answer):
mostly programmer is intended to write program as brief as possible.
The program you've wrote like that is a way to short the code. The
short the code, the hard you think how exactly that code works. Now
if you prefer to use that long code version than the short one, you
please to use it, there's no problem for choosing one of them.
