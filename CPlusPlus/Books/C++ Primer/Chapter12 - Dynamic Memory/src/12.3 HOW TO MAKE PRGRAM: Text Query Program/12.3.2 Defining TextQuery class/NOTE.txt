The QueryResult class will share the vector representing the input file and the 
sets that hold the line numbers associated with each word in the input. Hence, 
our class has two data members: a shared_ptr to a dynamically allocated vector 
that holds the input file, and a map from string to shared_ptr<set>. 

As usual, for code that will go in a header file, we use std:: when we use a 
library name (ยง 3.1,p. 83).
