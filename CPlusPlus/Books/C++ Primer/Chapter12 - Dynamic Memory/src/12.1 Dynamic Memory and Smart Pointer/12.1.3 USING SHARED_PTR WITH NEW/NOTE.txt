As weâ€™ve seen, if we do not initialize a smart pointer, it is initialized as a null pointer

By default, a pointer used to initialize a smart pointer must point to dynamic
memory because, by default, smart pointers use delete to free the associated
object.

When we bind a shared_ptr to a plain pointer, we give responsibility for that
memory to that shared_ptr. Once we give shared_ptr responsibility for a pointer,
we should no longer use a built-in pointer to access the memory to which the
shared_ptr now points
