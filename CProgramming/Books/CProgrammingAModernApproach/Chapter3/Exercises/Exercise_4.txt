Suppose that we call scanf as follows:

    int i, j;
    float x;

    scanf("%d%f%d", &i, &x, &j);

If the user enters

10.3 5 6

what will be the values of i, x, and j after the call?
(Assume that i and j are int variables and x is a float variable)

(answer):
= when the first %d is looking for int, the scanf stop when it
  encounter the decimal point(.) so it puts back

    i = 10;

= when the second %f is looking for float, the scanf recognizes
  the decimal point, and it starts to get the value from that 
  until it encounter the space

    x = .3

= when the last %d is looking for int, the scanf ignore the space
  after the .3 value and it found the non-space character and store
  the value into j

    j = 5

= the input of space and 6 digit will be put back and will be the input
  to the next scanf.
