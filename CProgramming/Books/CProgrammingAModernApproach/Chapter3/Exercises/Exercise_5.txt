Suppose that we call scanf as follows:

float x,y;
int i;

scanf("%f"%d%f", &x, &i, &y);

If the user enters

12.3 45.6 789

what will be the values of x, i and y after the call?
(Assume that x and y are float variables and i an int variable)

(answer);

= x will be 12.3
= i will be 45
= y will be 0.6
