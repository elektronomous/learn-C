For each of the following pairs of scanf format strings, indicate
whether or not the two strings are equivalent. If they're not, 
show how they can be distinguished.

(a) "%d"    versus " %d"    => same, the space before the format string could be ignored
                               by the scanf

(b) "%d-%d-%d" versus "%d -%d -%d" => distinguished, the space after the format string must
                                      match with the input

(c) "%f"    versus "%f "            => same, because there's no non-space character after the
                                       space

(d) "%f,%f" versus "%f, %f"         => same, because the space after ordinary character are ignored


= we got conclusion here that the space after format-string will match by the scanf
  and the space after the ordinary character like we saw earlier(|,-) are ignored by scanf
