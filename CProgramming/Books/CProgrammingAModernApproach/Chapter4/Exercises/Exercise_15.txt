Give the values of i and j after each of the following
expressions statements has been executed.
(Assume that i has the value 1 initially and j has the value 2)

    i = 1;
    j = 2;

(a) i += j;
(b) i--;
(c) i * j / i;
(d) i % ++j;

(answer):
(a) i = 3, j = 2;
(b) i = 0, j = 2
(c) (lost value) 2
(d) (lost value) 1, j = 3
