The algorithm for computing the UPC check digit ends with the following steps:

Subtract 1 from the total.
Compute the remainder when the adjusted total is divided by 10.
Subtract the remainder from 9

It's tempting to try to simplify the algorithm by using these steps instead:

Compute the remainder when the total is divided by 10.
Subtract the remainder from 10.

Why doesn't this technique work?

= Note for us is that check digit only from 0 - 9, so for exampe if
  the result of remainder is 0 then you substract it from 10 the result
  will be 10 which is not valid.
